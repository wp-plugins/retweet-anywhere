== Description ==

Retweet Anywhere for WordPress is a nice and easy way to allow your readers to instantly retweet your blog posts through their Twitter accounts. It uses the slick Twitter @Anywhere bundle which works through OAuth and never requires your readers to input their Twitter names or passwords.

The plugin is customizable, URLs could be shortened through bit.ly, the retweet format is defined by the blog administrator. Visitors can modify the tweet text before actually sending it to Twitter, allowing them to add hashtags or addressing somebody in particular.
